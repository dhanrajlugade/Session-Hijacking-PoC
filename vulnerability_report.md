# Detailed Technical Analysis: Session Hijacking

## 1. Vulnerability Description
**Vulnerability Type:** Session Hijacking via Predictable/Transferable Session IDs.
**Observed Behavior:**
The application relies solely on the validity of the Session ID for access control. It fails to verify that the ID holder is the correct user.
* **Scenario:** User A logs in. If User A replaces their Session ID with the active Session ID of User B, the system grants User A immediate access to User B's account.
* **Authentication Bypass:** No password or re-authentication is required for this swap.

## 2. Technical Root Cause
The fundamental issue is a failure in **Authorization (CWE-284)**.

### A. The Missing Check: Session-to-User Binding
A secure system must check two things:
1.  Is the Session ID valid? (The system does this).
2.  Does the user making the request *own* that session? (The system **fails** to do this).

| State Check | Secure System Action | Flawed System Action (Observed) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Session ID Validity** | Valid and not expired. | Valid and not expired. |
| **Session Owner Check** | Verifies request originated from correct user. | **Skips this critical check.** |
| **Result** | Access Denied. | **Access Granted.** |

### B. Attack Vectors
This flaw opens the door to real-world hijacking via:
* **Network Snooping:** Capturing IDs over non-HTTPS connections.
* **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Stealing session cookies via malicious scripts.
* **Session Fixation:** Forcing a known session ID onto a victim.

## 3. Business Impact
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can view/modify/delete private user data.
* **Reputation:** Loss of trust and potential regulatory fines (GDPR/CCPA).
* **Privilege Escalation:** If an Admin session is hijacked, the entire application is compromised.
